        <div class="about-me">I am a web developer living in Austin, TX currently seeking full-time employment. I studied full-stack development at Austin Coding Academy, but my passion is front-end development & UI/UX. My goal is to work remotely, or for a company in Austin, as a front-end developer. My favorite aspects of coding are learning new ways to manipulate data with Javascript functions, improving my UI/UX skills by learning things like Bootstrap & Material UI, and learning to build more complex apps & components with React. My least favorite thing about coding is Redux (haha...). I am originally from New Orleans, where I lived for most of my life and worked as an independent insurance adjuster for twelve years. I also lived in Los Angeles for 2 years, working at various restaurants in West LA. I currently work as an Uber driver, but I code every day (as you can see on my Github) and will keep coding until I get a job as a software developer. My hobbies are digital media production (music, graphic design, video editing), fitness, skateboarding, yoga and hiking the various parks & greenbelts around Austin. I also volunteer at the Community First! Village in East Austin.</div>
