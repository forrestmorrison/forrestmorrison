        <div class="about-me">I am a full stack web developer who graduated from Austin Coding Academy in 2022. I was born & raised in New Orleans, Louisiana until Hurricane Katrina flooded my house when I was sixteen years old. I went to Loyola University School of Music Business for one year, then became an insurance adjuster. I worked in insurance for 12 years, traveling often for work & living briefly in places like Bloomington, IL, Dallas, TX & Jacksonville, FL. I also lived in Los Angeles from 2014-2016 & worked at various restaurants in West LA. In 2021 I decided to relocate to Texas & pursue my dream of becoming a software developer. I currently live in the North Houston / Woodlands area where I would like to stay for the foreseeable future. Austin is my favorite major city to visit, but my overall favorite place to visit is Taos, New Mexico. I am hoping to get an RV so I can travel while working as a remote coder.</div>
