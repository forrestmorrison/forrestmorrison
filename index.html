        <div class="about-me">I am a full stack web developer who graduated from Austin Coding Academy in 2022. I was born & raised in New Orleans, Louisiana, where I lived until Hurricane Katrina flooded my house when I was sixteen years old. After Katrina, I moved to Mandeville, LA & graduated from Saint Pauls School in Covington, LA. I attended Loyola University (New Orleans) School of Music Business for one year, then became an insurance adjuster. I worked in insurance for 12 years, travelling often for work & living briefly in places like Bloomington, IL, Dallas, TX & Jacksonville, FL. I also lived in Los Angeles from 2014-2016 & worked at various restaurants in West LA. In 2021, after being in New Orleans for a 5 day power outage 2 years in a row, I made the decision to leave New Orleans & relocate to the Houston area. It is during this time that I discovered &, quickly thereafter, attended Austin Coding Academy. After spending just under a year in Houston, I have FINALLY made the move to Austin with the goal of getting an entry-level developer job & staying in Austin long-term!</div>
